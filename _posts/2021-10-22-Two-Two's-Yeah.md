Hey Carbon Nugget

Two Two's if you focus, and remain consistent, it feeds your determination to get where you're going. My teacher said to me just yesterday, 'repetition is key'.  This is my 3rd or 4th time trying to get my head around github. I realised I didn't have a _why_ before. The _why_ is really importsnt to me, helps with focus.
